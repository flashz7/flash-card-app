# flash-card-app
A flashcard app built in Python! Uses a CSV of words and their English translation, and allows the user to go through the list randomly as a set of "flash cards". 

The current data set is for the top 100 most used French words, but any list can be plugged in with two columns for the two respective languages. This app utilizes Pandas and Tkinter for data manipulation and the GUI.
